# Expression and regression models in metastatic tumors





In this section we will build regression models for cancer-related mortality (since all deaths are cancer-related deaths) according to clinical features and 5hmC expression. 5hmC expression will be categorized in low/high levels using as cutoff points: 1) the median; 2) the upper tertile. 

For age we will use the median to define categorical groups.

We will begin building uncondicional binary logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios. We then will build Cox's proportional hazards regression models to estimate the hazard ratios. Follow-up length will be defined as months from nephrectomy.

This section includes only the analysis of metastatic tumors. Primary tumors are analyzed separately.
